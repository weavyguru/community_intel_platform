- Use clear headings for different sections
- Include relevant quotes from source material
- End with recommended actions

## Key Areas to Monitor
- Feature requests for chat/collaboration features
- Integration questions
- Performance or reliability issues
- Comparisons with competitors (Lovable, Replit, etc.)`,

Monitor community activity across Discord, Reddit, X, and LinkedIn for actionable intelligence.

## Monitoring Priorities

### High Priority (Create Task Immediately)
- Direct mentions of @weavy or weavy.com
- Urgent bug reports or security issues
- High-engagement posts about chat/collaboration needs
- Competitive threats or opportunities

### Medium Priority (Create Task if Pattern Detected)
- Feature requests related to in-app communication
- Developer pain points with current solutions
- Trends in vibe coding platforms
- Questions about pricing or implementation

### Low Priority (Log but Don't Create Task)
- General discussions about development tools
- Positive mentions without specific asks
- Educational content opportunities

## Task Creation Criteria
A task should be created when:
1. Direct action is required from the Weavy team
2. Multiple users express the same need (trend detection)
3. Competitive intelligence requires strategic response
4. Time-sensitive opportunity exists

## Metadata to Capture
- Platform and author information
- Engagement metrics (likes, comments, shares)
- Sentiment analysis
- Related keywords and topics
- Potential business impact score`,
